## 2.10 VFR General Token Definition

### 2.10.1 GUID Definition

```c
Hex8 ::=
  "0x"["0"-"9""A"-"F""a"-"f"]{1,8}

Hex4 ::=
  "0x"["0"-"9""A"-"F""a"-"f"]{1,4}

Hex2 ::=
  "0x"["0"-"9""A"-"F""a"-"f"]{1,2}

guidSubDefinition ::=
  Hex2 "," Hex2 "," Hex2 "," Hex2 ","
  Hex2 "," Hex2 "," Hex2 "," Hex2

guidDefinition ::=
  "{"
  Hex8 "," Hex4 "," Hex4 ","
  (
      "{" guidSubDefinition "}"
    | guidSubDefinition
  )
  "}"
```

#### BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS

In practice, the VFR only supports GUIDs in a C-style language structure. It is
defined as two 32-bit values, followed by two 16-bit values, followed by eight
1-byte values.

### 2.10.2 String & String Identifier Definition

```c
StringIdentifier ::=
  ["A"-"Z""a"-"z""_"]["A"-"Z""a"-"z""_""0"-"9"]*

getStringId ::=
  "STRING_TOKEN" "(" Number ")"
```

**********
**Note:** There are no BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS or an Example for this
section.
**********

### 2.10.3 Number Definition

```c
Number ::=
  ( "0x"["0"-"9""A"-"F""a"-"f"]+ ) | ["0"-"9"]+
```

**********
**Note:** There are no BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS or an Example for this
section.
**********

### 2.10.4 VFR Statement Header Definition

```c
vfrStatementHeader  ::=
  "prompt" "=" getStringId ","
  "help"   "=" getStringId ","
```

**********
**Note:** There are no BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS or an Example for this
section.
**********

### 2.10.5 VFR Question Header Definition

```c
vfrQuestionHeader ::=
  { "name" "=" StringIdentifier "," }
  { "varid" "=" vfrStorageVarId "," }
  { "questionid" "=" Number "," }
  vfrStatementHeader

questionheaderFlagsField ::=
    "READ_ONLY"
  | "INTERACTIVE"
  | "RESET_REQUIRED"
  | "OPTIONS_ONLY"
  | "REST_STYLE"

vfrStorageVarId ::=
  ( StringIdentifier "[" Number "]" )
  |
  (
    StringIdentifier
    (
      "." StringIdentifier { "[" Number "]" }
    )*
  )
```

#### BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS

**********
**Note:** `questionid` is used to specify the question ID. If it is not defined,
the compiler automatically assigns a unique ID.
**********
**Note:** `name` is used to specify the reference name, which is optional.
**********
**Note:** The first `StringIdentifier` defined in `vfrStorageVarId` is the
varstore name or the structure name referred by varstore. When the same
structure is referred to by more than one varstore statement, only the varstore
name can be used here. If it is not defined, this question has no storage.
**********

####Example

None.

### 2.10.6 VFR Constant Value Definition

```c
vfrConstantValueField  ::=
    Number
  | "TRUE"
  | "FALSE"
  | "ONE"
  | "ONES"
  | "ZERO"
  | Number ":" Number ":" Number
  | Number "/" Number "/" Number
  | "STRING_TOKEN" "(" Number ")"
  | { Number ("," Number)* }
```

**********
**Note:** There are no BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS or an Example for this
section.
**********

### 2.10.7 VFR Statement Image & Locked Tag Definition

```c
vfrImageTag ::=
  "image" "=" "IMAGE_TOKEN" "(" Number ")"

vfrLockedTag ::=
  "locked"

vfrStatementStatTag ::=
  vfrImageTag | vfrLockedTag

vfrStatementStatTagList ::=
  vfrStatementStatTag ( "," vfrStatementStatTag )*
```

**********
**Note:** There are no BEHAVIORS AND RESTRICTIONS or an Example for this
section.
